## Summary
^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$
This regular expression is commonly used to validate email addresses. It matches any string that follows the general format of an email address.

^ matches the start of the string.

[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+ matches one or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, or some special characters that are commonly used in email addresses, such as ". _ % + -"

@ matches the @ symbol that separates the local part of the email address from the domain part.

[A-Za-z0-9.-]+ matches one or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, or the . (period) and - (hyphen) symbols that are commonly used in domain names.

\. matches a literal . (period), which separates the second-level domain from the top-level domain.

[A-Za-z]{2,} matches two or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), representing the top-level domain.

$ matches the end of the string.

So, this regular expression would match strings like john.doe@example.com, jane.smith123@hotmail.co.uk, and info@mycompany.com.

## Regex Components

^: This symbol matches the start of the string. It ensures that the regular expression will only match if the pattern begins at the start of the string. In this case, it means that the email address must begin at the start of the string.

`[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+: This is a character class that matches one or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, or some special characters that are commonly used in email addresses, such as . (period), _ (underscore), %, +, and -. 

@: This matches the @ symbol that separates the local part of the email address from the domain part.

[A-Za-z0-9.-]+: This is another character class that matches one or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, or the . (period) and - (hyphen) symbols that are commonly used in domain names.

\.: This matches a literal . (period). It needs to be escaped with a backslash \ because . is a special character in regular expressions that matches any character except a newline.

[A-Za-z]{2,}: This is another character class that matches two or more characters that can be letters (both uppercase and lowercase), representing the top-level domain.

$: This symbol matches the end of the string. It ensures that the regular expression will only match if the pattern ends at the end of the string. In this case, it means that the email address must end at the end of the string.

So, the regular expression as a whole matches any string that follows the general format of an email address.
